title: R for Data Analysis
---

Introduction to R for non-programmers.

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write code
for using R for data analysis. R is commonly used by many data scientists. Surveys show that R is the most popular 
software for statistical data analysis (76\% respondents use R for data analysis). As its popularity grows 
so does the number of third-party R packages (currently about 7700). 
This workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the 
programming language R. However it will not teach statistical analysis.

Note that this lesson is a modified version of the "R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis" lesson from
[here](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html). It was adapted to fit better the needs of the PSRC Data department.
